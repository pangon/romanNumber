roman numeral test

I have extended the specification to accept strings that represent exactly decimal numbers, they will be interpreted as passing the represented number.
The code for both roman->arabic and arabic->roman conversion could have been written more DRY, but I intentionally left some redundancy to improve readability and for easier understanding.
